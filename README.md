# Red
Pokemon Red clone in Python

# Running
This project requires no dependencies
just run the pokemon.py file or evolution.py file.

# issues
I am posting this code becuase im getting an error i dont know how to resolve.  When running pokemon.py it says species is not defined.  Even though i include species module which has the variable species defined in it.
Simliar problems arise when running ther other files in the project.
